# Trust Lesson

> Recently, I had lessons to get my driver's license. The lessons were remotely through a meeting service. This service usually takes pictures of the students and later does a manual verification to check that the picture really shows a student watching the classes. So I had an idea: It'd be awesome to create a similar system where human validation is done using computer vision, and I did.
